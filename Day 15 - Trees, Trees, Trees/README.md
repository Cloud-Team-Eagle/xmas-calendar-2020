Ho. Ho. Ho…

Sorry, but the last days were quite hectic – so this is probably the last challenge as starting next week not that many of you are working….


I had so much more things in mind, like “Sieve of Aristoteles”, Fun with Graphs, Sorting, etc… maybe next year or so…..  but this time we will stick to trees 😊


1.	Implement in algorithm to check if a tree has a loop. (It does not matter if the tree is binary or not – that’s up to you 😉)

2.	When searching through a binary tree with Depth-First-Search, there are 3 possibilities to output the nodes:
i.	Prefix
ii.	Infix
iii.	Postfix

Example 1: 
If you have a binary tree with the root node (+)  and the children A and B, then:
•	Prefix:     +  A  B 
•	Infix:        A  +  B
•	Postfix:    A  B  +

Exapmle 2:
 


Write 3 algorithms that prints out pre-, post-, and infix notation of the search.
3.	Write an algorithm that converts a tree to a list (infix order). 
4.	And finally, write an algorithm that converts a postfix expression into a prefix one.  😊



Do all or pick any of your liking! Enjoy 😊
